# Disaster Watch: Flood Prediction Web Application That Uses Decision Tree Algorithm to predict Floods.

## Overview
**Disaster Watch** is a web application designed to predict floods in informal settlement areas in Kenya using machine learning algorithms. This project leverages a Decision Tree algorithm to analyze historical rainfall data and forecast potential flood occurrences and their severity.

## Tools and Dependencies
- **Node js**: https://nodejs.org/en
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Pycharm IDE**
- **Anaconda**:https://www.anaconda.com/download
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Pandas, scikit-learn, tensorFlow
- **Web Frameworks** Laravel, Flask API

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/disaster-watch.git
    cd disaster-watch
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer require laravel/jetstream
    ```
3. **Install livewire Jetstream**
     ```bash
    php artisan jetstream:install livewire
    ```
4. **Run Npm module**

    ```
# Machine Learning installation
To run the machine learning model follow the steps:
1. **Install machine learning framework**
   ```bash
     pip install tensorflow

    ```
2. **Install Flask**
    ```bash
     pip install flask

    ```
  

## Usage
1. **Data Input:** Upload historical rainfall data in CSV format.
2. **Run Prediction:** Use the web interface to initiate the flood prediction process.
3. **View Results:** Access prediction results and insights through the user dashboard.

## Methodology
This project employs the **Structured System Analysis and Design Method (SSADM)** and a **Modified Waterfall Model** for system development. Key stages include:

1. **Requirement Analysis:** Identifying and documenting system requirements.
2. **Design:** Creating system architecture and design documents.
3. **Implementation:** Developing the flood prediction model and web interface.
4. **Testing:** Ensuring system functionality and accuracy.
5. **Operation and Maintenance:** Deploying the system and performing regular maintenance.
